# EV-Market-Segmentation
Market Size and Growth Opportunities for EV Types 
Potential for Electric Scooters & Motorbikes (Segments 0 & 1):

Total Two-wheeler sales in 2016: 18,937,104
Segments 0 (Young, low income) and 1 (Mid age, middle income) represent a large customer base (12293 individuals in the sample).
The strong growth trend in overall two-wheeler sales indicates a large potential market for electric variants.
Segment 0 (Electric Scooters) aligns with the urban youth and delivery workforce, likely early adopters due to lower price points and urban commuting needs.
Segment 1 (Electric Motorbikes) aligns with commuters in Tier 2 cities, suggesting potential in areas with developing infrastructure.

Potential for Compact Electric Cars & Premium EVs (Segments 2 & 3):

Total Passenger Car sales in 2016: 2,738,182
Segment 2 (Higher age, upper-middle income) represents a significant customer base (1608 individuals) for Compact Electric Cars, likely families.
Segment 3 (Older, high income) represents a smaller but high-value customer base (6099 individuals) for Premium EVs.
The steady growth in passenger car sales suggests increasing adoption potential for electric cars, particularly as charging infrastructure improves.
The higher income levels in segments 2 and 3 indicate a greater ability and willingness to invest in more expensive EV options.

Potential for Electric Commercial Vehicles:

Total Commercial Vehicle sales in 2016: 787,393
While not directly mapped to a specific segment in the age/income data, the delivery workforce (part of Segment 0's description) represents a key opportunity for electric commercial vehicles (e.g., electric three-wheelers or small vans).
The consistent commercial vehicle sales indicate a base market that could transition to electric, driven by operational cost savings and environmental regulations.

 Comprehensive Overview of Market Potential

Electric two-wheelers (scooters and motorbikes) have the largest potential market size due to the dominance of two-wheelers in overall vehicle sales and the large customer base in Segments 0 and 1. Growth will likely be driven by affordability and urban/Tier 2 commuting needs.
Electric passenger cars (compact and premium) have a growing market potential, supported by the increasing trend in car sales and the purchasing power of Segments 2 and 3. Infrastructure development is key for broader adoption.
Electric commercial vehicles represent a niche but growing opportunity, particularly for last-mile delivery and urban logistics, aligning with needs seen in segments like the delivery workforce (part of Segment 0).
